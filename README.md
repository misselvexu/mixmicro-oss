### Building from Source

You donâ€™t need to build from source to use `Mixmicro+ OSS` (binaries in [repo.maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org)), 
but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, 
`Mixmicro+ OSS` can be easily built with the maven wrapper. You also need JDK 1.8.

*First* : git clone source from gitlab
 
```bash
$ git clone ssh://git@git.hgj.net:8022/mixmicro/mixmicro-oss.git
```

*Second* : build

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need [Maven v3.5.0 or above](https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html).
